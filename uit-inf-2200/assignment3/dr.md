simu implem:
    - how to implement L1 instruction, L1 data, L2 unified as hierarchy?
    - how are you going to implement size, associativity, line size, policy (write-back, etc.), replacement policy as parameters?
    - how to test your simulator?
report:
    - how are you going to find which parameters are the best performance-wise for your a1 benchmark, presentation of results?
    - how are you going to find the cost of implementing it on real hardware?
